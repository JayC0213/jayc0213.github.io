		Hello, my name is Julian Eduardo Cabadas and this is my work practice in my portfolio. There will be a disclaimer on my line of work that I’m showcasing today. I do not have Art 75 projects on the ready because I never took Art 74 here at SJSU and my transfer class for it, DM 001, was an intro to digital media that had coursework relating to Adobe programs, rather than a focus on HTML. My first ever experience with HTML was this Spring with Steve Durie in Art 101 and this will be the replacement for the Art 74 work. My goal here as an artist when transferring here was to work on improving in Web and 3D design, which is the core factor why I was excited to be in Art 101, learning HTML in the process while taking the class was rough, but also an enjoyable experience at the same time. When I started to get a grasp on creating some works with p5.js and working around editing my web page for the class, I had more interest than ever when it came to web and digital media design, it gave me the freedom to research more on parent functions and how everything can correlate with each other when put together right. When it came to creating some of my first exercises and projects, it was interesting how everything was being put together at first but the moment you get hands-on with the work, it’s something I won’t truly forget. Easily one of the hardest and most amazing classes I have ever taken, it tested my limits at the time on what I wanted to make, from creating my paint tools, to creating my first-ever tree-growing animation, creating a parent function that creates a real-time clock for me, and finally, my little experiment of creating an AI buddy with button functions. These experiences are always what I wanted to test out in coding and it’s something that will always stay in my mind as one of the most challenging but fun times of my life. I wanted the focus to be on the quality of my work and what I can do differently next time when it comes to coding again. For my Art 75 class, I always had an interest in video editing and what I could do with footage I already had. By experimenting with video editing came up with the idea of what I can do as a person to make a change or make decisions based on “life story” like elements. What I mean by this is I wanted to make my videos feel like they’re coming from a point of view of my life, but with a lot of different aspects of motives. For my final piece, I wanted to showcase just a piece I worked on my own and something standard I wanted to get myself into Digital Media, which is my little gecko buddy. This was the first official work that I did when it came to creating my first project and testing the waters on digital media. Everything else has been pictorial up to this point and when I created this Gecko piece, it was my call to work on digital works more, it’s the reason I pushed my work in Adobe or JavaScript more every day and see where my limits end. My goal is to make pieces that correlate with what I love to make while pushing for the quality I’m looking for in my pieces.<br>
