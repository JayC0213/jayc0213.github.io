  My own personal project that got me into Digital Media. <br>    
      
      before I got into DMA, I was  more into Pictorial since I grew up without any form of DMA programs such as Adobe. But once growing up into high school, then transfering to Cabrillo College, given a free subscription of Adobe Illustrator changed everything for me. I started a love for water color painting at the time and I wanted to use the tools in Illustrator to showcase those skills, and with one of my favorite reptiles on the planet.<br>

  First ever project video I did. Testing out both the video quality and sound recorder I had on my iPhone and this was the result.  <br>    
      
      The mission was essentially to have the minute be at least 1 minute with different amount of "life" sounds that I can find or come up with.<br>
      The result is what I wanted and it shows how far technology has come to both it's video and sound quality. <br>

          A video that tests more in the waters of video scene sequences. <br>    
              
              Wanted to start my day off and what exactly I do when I start my day. There was a lot of amazing sequences, but I really wanted to use the sequences I chose that really fit the theme of my video.<br>

		<p>
		This project felt interesting because we essentially created our own mini version of paint/adobe illustrator. 
    In this, you can press on the keys '1-4' for various drawing tools and key '5' for eraser. Then use key '-' or '_' to clear the canvas.  <br>    
        
        I felt like what I wanted to use here was very unique but also very weird and that was the goal, to create tools that are not similar but are very interesting to use. <br>
        The only challenges I had was finding a good 'random' function to complement the other colors I have and finding different to use these tools. <br>

		<p>
		My second project consisted of two different classes that show case the water being sprinkled to the pot for the tree to grow. Many different methods and a function were involved for this to happen and the classes that were consisted here were both jcTree and jcRain, and the methods were help to display and loop a bit of the water particles that help the tree grow.<br>
    
      <p></p>This one was very difficult so far as I didn't know exactly which methods did exactly what, but the more I messed around with it and change it into the class/constructor format, it made more sense and a lot more simple to look at.
        
        <p></p> There is also a video below to show animation in full with a stop. Here are some links to the examples I used:<br>

		<p>
		My third project is a focus on my everyday use of technology and wanted to create time using "progress bars." The rest will indicate on my everyday uses on what kind of apps I use. The background and the visual time display will should the person what time it is whether the background goes light or dark, depending on the hours, which are 6-17 for day time, while 18-5 for night time. I also wanted an alert system displaying image visuals and text display on what I mostly do on a daily basis that doesn't involve classes for the most part, but when I do on the daily. <br>
    
      <p></p>This to me was very confusing at first, and didn't know what exactly I wanted till I thought of the everyday use of technology for myself. It may not be healthy to many, but I find it very fascinating and love using programs to create things I want.

           <h5> "AI Buddy: Blob The Helper" [Art 101]</h5>
      <p>
      My final project for Art 101. This has been a very time consuming project that I have done to date but it was a lot of fun and interesting to play out. <br>
      
        <p>The main focus on this project was 2 libraries using mostly p5.buttons, with a little use of p5.play to get some character animation in there. P5.buttons had more use in this project due to using buttons.js and changing the properties of the buttons within scenes.js. Using the focus on "style_default" to change it's color and even its transparency. It was difficult to figure out how to change the properties for each button use, but it was actually within the code the whole time, while the Github page really helped a lot.</p>
  
        <p>P5.Play has its use on adding the property "addAni" to add my drawn animation of my character. It was more of a simple use but I wanted to make the character feel alive during the interactions rather than just a still image at all times. Had to make it "false" in certain scenes until the interactive scenes came by and claim it as "true" afterwards for it to appear.<br>
        
          <p>I wanted this concept to have "Theatrification" while also having "Flat Design" as the main interface contexts. For theatrification, I wanted the AI have this interaction with the user rather than be a "tool," something that can be rememorable and have certain actions that can help the user. Flat design is to make the program look simple to use without any clutter UI experience for anyone to use. This inspired me this most to do because of Clippy and certain modern AI's today like Alexa and Siri, but I wanted it to be more about the user rather than the experience of the program. This was something I had a lot of fun with and I really want to mess with other libraries in the future!</p> <br>
