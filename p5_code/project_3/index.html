<h1> <strong>Project 3</strong> </h1>

<p> For this project, I wanted to represent my everyday use of technology but also tell a unique way of showing what time it is without any numbers being shown. I always wanted to represent certain time hours and visuals along side it, while also giving alerts to almost everyday of what I do. It's suppose to emulate as a phone screen use and what it is used in my spare time with some references to my life. </p>
